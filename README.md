# Employee-Summary

As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles





In the Develop folder, there is a package.json, so make sure to npm install.
The dependencies are, jest for running the provided tests, and inquirer for collecting input from the user.
There are also unit tests to help you build the classes necessary.
It is recommended that you follow this workflow:

Run tests
Create or update classes to pass a single test case
Repeat

ðŸŽ— Remember, you can run the tests at any time with npm run test
It is recommended that you start with a directory structure that looks like this:
lib/           // classes and helper code
output/        // rendered output
templates/     // HTML template(s)
test/          // jest tests
  Employee.test.js
  Engineer.test.js
  Intern.test.js
  Manager.test.js
app.js         // Runs the application

Hints


Create multiple HTML templates for each type of user. For example, you could use the following templates:


main.html


engineer.html


intern.html


manager.html




You will want to make your methods as pure as possible. This means try to make your methods simple so that they are easier to test.


The different employee types should all inherit some methods and properties from a base class of Employee.


In your HTML template files, you may want to add a placeholder character that helps your program identify where the dynamic markup begins and ends.



Minimum Requirements


Functional application.


GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.


User can use the CLI to generate an HTML page that displays information about their team.


All tests must pass.



Classes
The project must have the these classes: Employee, Manager, Engineer,
Intern. The tests for these classes in the tests directory must all pass.
The first class is an Employee parent class with the following properties and
methods:

name
id
email
getName()
getId()
getEmail()
getRole() // Returns 'Employee'

The other three classes will extend Employee.
In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Manager will also have:


officeNumber


getRole() // Overridden to return 'Manager'


In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Engineer will also have:


github  // GitHub username


getGithub()


getRole() // Overridden to return 'Engineer'


In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Intern will also have:


school


getSchool()


getRole() // Overridden to return 'Intern'



User input
The project must prompt the user to build an engineering team. An engineering
team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns.

Roster output
The project must generate a team.html page in the output directory, that displays a nicely formatted team roster. Each team member should display the following in no particular order:


Name


Role


ID


Role-specific property (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)
