# Template Engine-Employee Profile Generator

# Background

This application will dynamically create a team of engineers and interns. The user will be given a set of questions about each employee. The user will be asked the name, id , email, and role of the employee. The user will be able to pick how many people he/she wants on the team. I did have some trouble trying to figure out to display answers for the questions. I had help making this application but i would not have finished this app if I didnt recieve the given support.
